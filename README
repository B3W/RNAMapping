Find SRA accession numbers for analyzing on NCBI and download into accession_nums folder

Use 'retrieve_sra.sh accession_nums/organism_folder/accessions.txt' to get the .sra files associated with accession numbers
    .sra files can be found in 'ncbi/public/sra/' 

Copy appropriate .sra into 'sra_files/organism_folder/'

Use 'dir_sra2fastq.sh sra_files/organism_folder/' to convert all .sra files in 'sra_files/organism_folder' to fastq format
    Fastq files located in 'fastq_files/organism_folder/'

Download gzipped fasta file containing CDS sequences of genome from ensemblgenomes.org into 'genome_cds/organism_folder/'
Unzip with gunzip

Index CDSs with 'kallisto_index.sh genome_cds/organism_folder/organism_cds.fa'
Move to 'indexed_genome_cds/organism_folder'

Map fastq files with: 
    'kallisto_map_fastq.sh tpm_data/organism_folder				\
    			   indexed_genome_cds/organism_folder/organism_cds	\
			   fastq_files/organism_folder/acc_num_1.fastq.gz 	\
			   fastq_files/organism_folder/acc_num_2.fastq.gz'

Extract tpm data from .tsv files and merg into one file containing only tpm data:
    'merge_tpm.sh tpm_data/organim_folder'  

NOTE: In current state, directory structure should be set up prior to using the scripts.
